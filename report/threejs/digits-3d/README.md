# 3D digit-token trajectory viewer

This viewer follows the single-file Three.js report style in this directory,
including OrbitControls, canvas labels, a dark explanatory panel, and keyboard
controls. Width-3 runs show native coordinates. Higher-dimensional runs use a
single PCA basis fitted across every token and checkpoint, rather than fitting
each frame independently, so motion remains comparable over time.

Run `demos/digits_3d_trajectory_demo.sh` from the repository root to generate
`token_trajectories.json`. Then serve the repository with
`python3 -m http.server 8000` and visit
`http://localhost:8000/report/threejs/digits-3d/index.html`.

Orange points are trained digit-like tokens. Blue points are configurable
letters that exist in the vocabulary and model parameters but never occur in
either dataset split. Use the slider, arrow keys, or Space playback to compare
their trajectories over checkpoint time.

By default embeddings remain on the radius-`sqrt(EMBEDDING_DIM)` sphere, so
motion in model space is directional. A wireframe sphere is shown only for
native 3D runs because PCA does not preserve individual vector norms. Run the
demo with `WTE_FIXED_NORM=false` to produce the unconstrained view.

The viewer also accepts `?data=<relative-json-path>`. The sweep demo uses this
to keep every vocabulary-size and fixed-norm variation under `runs/` rather
than overwriting the default trajectory.

The default sweep uses 3 dimensions, 10 trained symbols, 10 held-out letters,
and both tied and untied WTE/LM-head runs, with 10,000 iterations per
configuration. Set `EMBEDDING_DIMS` (for example, `3 8 16 64`),
`DIGIT_COUNTS`, `LETTER_COUNTS`, `WTE_TYING_MODES`, or `SWEEP_MAX_ITERS` to
customize it.

After the first sweep run completes, open `sweep.html` to filter and select the
generated JSON files without editing URLs. Each trajectory includes checkpoint
train and validation loss; the viewer plots both above the time slider and
marks the currently selected checkpoint.

The sweep rewrites `runs/manifest.json` atomically after every completed run.
You can therefore keep the HTTP server open and refresh `sweep.html` while the
remaining configurations continue training.
